# Hotline that prints messages in front of my face
Since I'm not really prone to look at my phone people often can't reach me. To solve this I want to make the messages something fysical in my workspace and make them more 'in my face.' Inspired by [Thinkernut's Alexa Printer](https://www.hackster.io/tinkernut/cheap-alexa-printer-from-an-old-receipt-printer-c14ea2) am I going to do this by placing a thermal printer (like you find in stores) on my desk to which people in need can send messages. They can do this by going to a special super secret URL (aka a subdomain on my future website).
### Goals
- Designing front-end for writers,
- Make printer print mesages and personal information in a pre-specified format.
- Save all messages in a database
- Maybe Pushbullet integration to get an alert when I'm away from my hotline.
